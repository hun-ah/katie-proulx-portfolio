      "EMS response times average between 10-15 minutes in France, which can be far too long to result in positive outcomes for certain injuries (such as heart attack). Additionally, in order to receive medical help, someone must first see that you are in need of help, then call 112. This can result in even higher overall EMS response time.",

      "In addition to a standard sign up flow, asking the user for their emergency contacts was an important request. Even more important, however, was the opt-in as a community responder - this opt-in is critical to building a network of citizens that are willing to come to the aid of another, and potentially save a life.",
